I'm just getting started with programming, but this didn't work for me. even after changing
/mycanvas to /canvas. The console logger says that Sk is not defined

The skulpt.min.js and skulpt-stdlib.js need to be included with this, or provide a full URL for them. For example:

<script src="http://skulpt.org/static/skulpt.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="http://skulpt.org/static/skulpt-stdlib.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

The section should have the full url to the JS files. like this:

    <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.0/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script> 
    <script src="http://www.skulpt.org/static/skulpt.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script> 
    <script src="http://www.skulpt.org/static/skulpt-stdlib.js" type="text/javascript"></script> 
Or, see this gist: https://gist.github.com/akaak/42d4a78cef7f208bc343 and it works!

I just updated this gist, and there are a few small but important changes to notice.

Notice that we now wrap the Sk.importMainWithBody inside Sk.misceval.asyncToPromise (lines 36-44) Also notice that there is a fourth parameter Sk.importMainWithBody("", false, prog, true); which is set to true to enable async processing. This has the amazing effect that turtle now runs asynchronously! No more will the turtle slow down as the drawing becomes larger, no more do precompute the entire drawing and then animate it later. Now it runs in real time. Which also means that we can, and do, support events: onclick, onkey, ontimer!
We also made the change that you no longer need to supply a canvas element. (line 61) You now provide a div. and turtle will create the appropriate drawing context. Still a canvas for now, but could be SVG or webgl or whatever in the future.
Instead of Sk.canvas we now use the more generic way of connecting the canvas with (Sk.TurtleGraphics || (Sk.TurtleGraphics = {})).target = 'mycanvas'; (line 35)

I copy-pasted the gist into my project as a test run and it works smoothly. A big thanks to all those involved for the quick replies and easy fixes.
A quick question though:
How can I adjust the size/border/... of the 'mycanvas' div if it is no longer a canvas?

@bnmnetp

bnmnetp commented on 24 Mar 2015
You can adjust the size in a couple of ways: Sk.TurtleGraphics.target.height = will give an initial height. It will also respect a call to Screen.setup(height,width) in the turtle program itself. bordering can be done with CSS.

I have been able to run this successfully on my webpage with no issues. I then decided to try and modify the python code with my own code, but now when I hit run nothing happens? Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

bnmnetp commented on 26 Apr 2015
Have you checked the javascript console? Its pretty hard to know what happened without knowing how you changed the python or anything else. The most likely explanation is that you have an error in your python. In that case you will see the error message in the javascript console. That is what the console.log(err.toString) call does.

How do I include the turtle canvas? I went to CodeMirror and downloaded the turtle.js file, now where do I add the javascript code? I added it in the HEAD section, the FORM section, and wrapped it around the FORM section. I don't know what it means by, "include a canvas." Where do I include that code? What code do I include? Thanks for the help!

@polyphemus11, you don't need to do anything more, this gist has everything you need to run the example on the page itself. The canvas element is automatically added to the div. Did the page not work for you?

Is there any known browser compatibility issues? I am forced to use POS IE 10 at work and when I want to try and build my own Skulpt here it does not seem to work. All I get is a large black bar across the bottom and nothing outputs when I hit run. I have not made any modifications to the script either in the html or javascripts. Thanks!

@geeksailor
geeksailor commented on 24 Aug 2015
Side note, I did load it into Firefox Portable (FPP) which I have and it appears to work fine. I would like to try and see if I can get it to work in IE though so I don't possibly get in trouble using a program I am not allowed to use.

Do the examples at skulpt.org work in IE for you? I'm a little surprised it doesn't just work. Not that I test IE regularly, but the last time I tried everything worked fine.

The Skulpt site works fine for me oddly enough.

I edited the html to run the javascripts locally rather than remotely from the Skulpt site and enabled error output and I got the following error now:

This is awesome! I love Python, but I know almost nothing about HTML and Javascript. Is there a way to just get it to run the code without making a textbox and "Run" button?

@ghost
ghost commented on 22 Aug 2016
@Carcabob you have to have a python web server and server interaction for that, not with Skulpt. Skulpt is just an emulator of python.

@saibotshamtul
saibotshamtul commented on 11 Oct 2016 â€¢ 
@Carcabob Yes, it can be done, if, at the bottom of the page, you add Javascript code that calls the runit function, it should run the code when the page loads. You can combine this with making the textbox display:none to hide it, and it should work how you want.

For example: http://codepen.io/saibotshamtul/full/LRmpmm/

Hi, I am very new to programming. I am learning python and have created an interactive blackjack game that I wanted to share on my squarespace website. I tried posting in the gist on a squarespace code block and the run button and python text showed up but there is nowhere for the output to show up and nothing happens when I click run. Any advice?

Thanks!!

I'm skeptical that line 33 is necessary:

Sk.pre = "output";

It seems to duplicate the role of the outf function.

It seems to work for me when I comment it out.

It will work fine if that is the only instance of skulpt on the page. This may be totally left over, but it is important that we can have multiple instances of skulpt running on the page each with their own distinct output, and early on, if I recall correctly, this was a way to handle that. I never committed to making this a minimal perfect gist.

Hi I was trying to teach a friend some javascript and he was using skulpt. I are quite many anti-patterns used in the above I rewrote it with him while explaining the what/why. Note I'm using newer browser features like ?. and arrow-functions so will only work in evergreen browsers. However I assume most people will work in a package.json env using some form of transpiler.

I will just leave the snippet here incase you want to use some if it. You can dial back the features used but newer ordering make more sense.

Notes:

jquery isn't used just confuse people that its imported.
Sk.pre = "output"; @ line 33 what is this doing it make no sense and code runs fine without it.
import the script at the end of the body this mean that the html is present when document.get... is called so the references can be cache and its easier to spot the moving parts.
